<b>Freddie “Cannonball” Albertoni</b> is a Swiss bass player who has been on
the Swiss-Italian blues scene for 15 years. He was the founder of a renowned
local blues/rock band called ‘The Flag’ and for many years a bass player for
legendary Swiss bluesman <b>Bat Battiston</b>. In autumn 2018, Federico
Albertoni decides to take the frontman role, to start singing and to form his
own 100% blues band: <b>Freddie & The Cannonballs</b>. The experienced and
talented musicians who joined his sexted are his musical brother <b>Mad
Mantello</b> (guitar), drummer <b>Roberto Panzeri</b>, <b>Cristiano Arcioni</b>
(organ) and saxophone players <b>Nigel Casey</b> and <b>Olmo Antezana</b>.
Having a small horn section allows Freddie’s band to have the swinging sound of
the blues of the 50s and to combine it with modern sounds too. The band’s
repertoire features many original songs as well as a substantial tribute to
Jimmie Vaughan. The band’s first record, i.e. an EP entitled “F” which features
four original songs, will come out in May 2019.
